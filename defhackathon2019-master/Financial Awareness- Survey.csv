Um... 6000usd, but if you consider credit card debts than it could be less than a dollar","I'm a credit score genius","Yes, definitely","I am concerned about my data privacy. Research Tip - I would like to how my transaction(debt/credit) patterns over the years affect my credit rating. I am a super saiyan in debt management, so whenever I plan to take a loan, I do my own calculations of my potential earnings vs debt EMI. I keep track of it mentally now, used to keep an excel sheet. But anyways people want to see more information about their transaction patters(earnings vs expense vs credit vs debt) that they can help them take informed decisions about their finances. 

My credit score is just a number and a table of all my debts and EMIs. It’s just static info. I’d rather pay a small fee for the analysis too. It will save me time and efforts. Also if the paid service could recommend me ways to save tax from my debts. That is also one thing most are not aware of. ICICI bank has done this amazing thing where I can get my credit score on the dashboard with a single click.(very small fee) They already give the rest of the analysis. So it helps that way."
